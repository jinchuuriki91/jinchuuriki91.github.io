description: A brief look into what InfluxDB is
---

## Just to quote Wiki

```
InfluxDB is an open-source time series database developed by InfluxData. 
It is written in Go and optimized for fast, high-availability storage and
retrieval of time series data in fields such as operations monitoring, 
application metrics, Internet of Things sensor data, and real-time analytics.
```

But before we jump down that rabbit hole, let's wrap our heads around
what Time Series Databases (TSDB) are ...

## Time Series Database

Time Series Database is a database designed specifically to work with time stamped data.

In layman's term
> A timestamp is your only Primary Key to read a data point.

_**Note:** Going ahead we'll refer Time Series Database as TSDB. Ok fine I'm lazy_ ðŸ˜…


#### TSDB usage
* Event tracking, monitoring and aggregate data over time
* Server metrics
* Application performance monitoring
* Network and Sensor data
* Trades in a market
